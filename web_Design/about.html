      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m Sahil Magar, and football is one of my biggest interests. I enjoy the tactics, the emotion,
        and the atmosphere that only live football can create. This website is a football journal and a web design project
        where I share a match-day experience and the teams and players I personally support.
      </p>

      <h2>My favourite club: Manchester United</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Manchester United</strong> is my favourite club because of its history, iconic players, and the identity
        of fighting until the final whistle. Supporting a club is not only about results — it’s about loyalty, memories,
        and staying with the team through different seasons.
      </p>

      <h3>Why I support Manchester United</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The club’s history and tradition</li>
        <li>The passion of fans around the world</li>
        <li>Big moments and dramatic matches</li>
        <li>The belief that comebacks can happen</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Favourite Manchester United player: Bruno Fernandes</h3>
      <p>
        My favourite Manchester United player is <strong>Bruno Fernandes</strong>. I like him because he plays with
        leadership and responsibility and often feels like the main player pushing the team forward. He creates chances,
        scores important goals, and keeps the team organised, which is why many fans feel he is “carrying” the team each season.
      </p>

      <h2>Match-day journal: Brazil vs Senegal (FIFA International Friendly)</h2>
      <p>
        On <strong>15 November</strong>, I visited <strong>Emirates Stadium</strong> to watch
        <strong>Brazil vs Senegal</strong> in a <strong>FIFA International Friendly</strong>.
        Watching an international match live was a special experience because the atmosphere felt different compared to club football.
        There were fans from both nations, flags in the stands, and loud reactions to every attacking move.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sound was the first thing I noticed — chants starting in one section and spreading across the stadium.
        Every pass and tackle felt quicker in real life, and the crowd reacted instantly. What made the night special was the
        shared emotion: a good attack lifted the noise immediately, while a missed chance created a loud collective groan.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I support Brazil internationally</h2>
      <p>
        At international level, I support <strong>Brazil</strong>. The main reason is <strong>Neymar</strong>, who is my
        all-time favourite football player. I admire his creativity, confidence, and technical skill. Neymar’s style of play
        represents what I enjoy most about football — flair, quick decision-making, and the ability to change a match in one moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of Neymar, I became more interested in Brazil and started following their international matches.
        Seeing Brazil play live at Emirates Stadium felt meaningful to me because I was watching a national team I strongly support.
